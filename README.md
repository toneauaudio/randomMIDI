## randomMIDI

This sophisticated program possesses the 
capability to autonomously generate a 
comprehensive range of MIDI notes, 
subsequently exporting them as a MIDI 
file. It serves as the cornerstone of an 
extensive, ongoing project currently 
in development. Our ultimate objective is 
to create a cutting-edge MIDI generator 
plugin that empowers users to input their 
own parameters, enabling them to effortlessly 
obtain a customized file that aligns precisely 
with their desired musical characteristics.

### Current Development Status:

    We have successfully implemented the foundational framework for MIDI file generation, establishing a solid base. Currently, the note creation process relies on pure randomization. However, our upcoming development phase will prioritize refining this aspect by incorporating limitations and controlled algorithms into the note generation process. This strategic approach will enhance the precision and musicality of the generated MIDI notes, ensuring a more refined and tailored output.
